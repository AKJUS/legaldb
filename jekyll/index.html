<p>Welcome to the Creative Commons Legal Database! This database comprises case law and legal scholarship to help you learn more about legal issues surrounding Creative Commons licenses and legal tools. These resources aim to help you clearly understand the enforceability and precedents set by courts around the world concerning Creative Commons licenses. The Case Law Database includes court decisions from around the globe concerning Creative Commons. The Scholarship Database aims to provide users with articles and resources concerning the use, interpretation, and enforceability of Creative Commons licenses.</p>

<p>The information contained in the Creative Commons Legal Database has been contributed by many dedicated members of the <a href="https://network.creativecommons.org/">CC Global Network</a> and CC staff. While the resources are not exhaustive nor are the summaries provided to be considered legal advice, we provide this collection to assist our community in understanding how CC legal tools have been interpreted by courts and how they operate the larger legal ecosystem.</p>
