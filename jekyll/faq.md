What is the CC Legal Database?
==============================

This database contains case law and legal scholarship about CC licenses and the issues that relate to their enforceability and interpretation and is designed to educate the public about Creative Commons licenses and our other legal tools. The aim of the database is to congregate court decisions and articles concerning our legal tools in a searchable, easy-to-use database, to help document and provide understanding of how courts have interpreted and enforced their terms or the legal ecosystem in which they are used. Please note that the database is not comprehensive, nor does CC necessarily endorse the views of either the courts or the scholars whose decisions and writings are referenced. The summaries are just that -- they reflect the opinions of the author only and not of CC. The database and the summarized information provided should not be relied upon as official guidance, and the cases and writings do not reflect CCâ€™s opinions on the issues and topics discussed. The content provided is purely informational, for those researching and hoping to understand the legal ecosystem in which CC legal tools are used and interpreted.

How do I use the database?
==========================

The database consists of two parts. The first contains court cases primarily involving decisions in which a CC license or other public license has been the focus of dispute (the Case Law Database). The second contains legal scholarship directly relevant to CC licenses and legal systems in which they operate and are interpreted (the Scholarship Database). We provide different options for searching the database. 

Are the summaries provided from the cases official statements or interpretations? 
=================================================================================

The summaries provide are NOT official statements and NOT endorsed by Creative Commons, and must not be relied upon as such. Additionally, the summaries and contents of the database are in no way to be relied upon as legal advice, and you should consult your own attorney for interpretations on which you intend to rely. CC is not your lawyer, nor can we give you legal advice. We highly recommend you review the entire legal decision and other documents (many of which may not be part of the Case Law Database) before deciding what a decision may or may not mean for you and your specific circumstances.

How can I contribute?
=====================

We welcome contributions to the CC Legal Database. Our goal is to gather as many cases and relevant pieces of scholarship as possible, in order to provide information about CC licenses and their interpretation and enforceability. You may contribute using [the forms found here](../contribute/). Note that your contribution may be reviewed for accuracy and relevancy before it is made public on our site.
