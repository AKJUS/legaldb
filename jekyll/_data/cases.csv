Linchôdmapwa v L'asbl Festival de Theatre de Spa,Belgium,Belgium,Le Tribunal de Premiere Instance (court of first instance),French,2010-10-28,,CC BY-NC-ND,2. 0,Ported,Musical work,Violation of CC BY-NC-ND,09-1684-A,https://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/f/f6/2010-10-26_A%27cision-trib.-Nivelles-Lichodmapwa.pdf,,Belgian court found a theater company liable for violating the CC BY-NC-ND license on a musical work. (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 Belgium),Plaintiff alleged a musical work licensed under CC BY-NC-ND was used by a theatre company in an advertisement in violation of all three terms of the license.,"BACKGROUND In 2004, the Belgian band Lichôdmapwa released the song “Abatchouck” under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 Belgium license. Several years later, one of the band members heard 20 seconds of the 3 minute and 20 second song on an advertisement for a theater and festival company. Lichôdmapwa contacted the theater company to see if they could negotiate a deal. The negotiations failed and Lichôdmapwa sued the theater company for copyright infringement in September of 2009.

SUMMARY Lichôdmapwa claimed the theater company had violated all three of the terms of their chosen CC license. The theater had modified the original work to make it fit in the commercial, violating the No Derivatives provision. The theater violated the Non-Commercial clause by using the work in an advertisement. And the theater violated the Attribution requirement by not including any mention of the song’s artist in the commercial.

The band asked for 10,380 Euros in damages, plus to have the theater pay for the publication of the court’s judgment in a magazine called “Dogmagazine.”
The theater company attempted to claim ignorance, arguing that it was unaware of the terms of the license. It appears the theater also argued that since Lichôdmapwa is not a member of the Belgian collecting society, SABAM, the band had no rights to collect payments for the music’s use.
Judge Vandeput did not agree with the theater company’s defenses. She recognized the validity of Creative Commons licenses. She also confirmed that the musicians’ decision to not join SABAM and instead release their music more openly should not prevent enforcement of the license.

As to the theater company’s claim of ignorance, Judge Vandeput found that this was no excuse for violating the license. As an organizer of festivals and a company involved in using licensing, the company should have known to look for and follow the terms of the license. In addition, the website from which the theater downloaded the music, http://www.dogmazic.net, clearly mentions the terms of the license. There was no reason for the theater company not to know about the license or its terms.
RESULT Even though the band is not part of SABAM, the court held that they suffered damages. The Judge awarded the band 1,500 Euros per license term violated, 4,500 Euros in total.","In 2004, the Belgian band Lichôdmapwa released the song “Abatchouck” under CC BY-NC-ND 2.5 Belgium license. Several years later, one of the band members heard a portion of the song in an advertisement for a theater festival run by a nonprofit organization. Lichôdmapwa contacted the organization to see if they could negotiate a deal. The negotiations failed, and Lichôdmapwa sued the organization for copyright infringement in September 2009.","Lichôdmapwa claimed the defendant violated all three conditions of the applicable CC license. The defendant had modified the original work, used the work for commercial purposes, and failed to provide attribution. The defendant claimed it had acted in good faith, arguing that it was unaware of the terms of the CC license. The defendant also argued that since the plaintiff was not a member of the Belgian collecting society, SABAM, they had no rights to collect payments for use of the music.  The court recognized the validity of the Creative Commons license applied to the music, and held that the plaintiff’s decision not to join SABAM and instead to release their music more openly should not prevent them from enforcing their copyright. The court held that the good faith of the defendant was not an excuse for violating the license. As a festival organizer regularly involved in licensing, the court said the defendant should have known to look for and follow the terms of the license. In addition, the court noted that the website from which the theater downloaded the music, http://www.dogmazic.net, clearly mentions the CC license.","On October 28, 2010, the court awarded the plaintiff 1,500 Euros per license condition violated, 4,500 Euros in total.",The court specifically addressed and upheld the validity and enforceability of the CC license applied to the work at issue.,,Publish

An Australian mobile company used a Flickr photo of a minor subject licensed under CC BY 2.0 unported as part of its advertising campaign launched in 2007. In September 2007, Plaintiffs brought suit against the mobile company under a number of causes of action, including invasion of privacy, copyright infringement and breach of contract. They also brought suit against Creative Commons alleging CC had negligently failed to sufficiently warn creators that CC licenses only address copyright and not privacy and publicity rights.

SUMMARY
Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed CC from the lawsuit in November 2007. In January 2009, the Texas district court dismissed the case against the mobile company for lack of personal jurisdiction.

RESULT
Creative Commons licenses only address the creator's copyright. It does not affirmatively affect publicity or privacy rights. Users of CC-licensed material should make sure to clear the publicity and privacy rights of any works containing human subjects before reusing CC-licensed works.","Virgin Mobile, an Australian mobile device company, used a Flickr photo of a minor licensed under a CC BY 2.0 license as part of an advertising campaign it launched in 2007.  The plaintiff alleged that Virgin violated the attribution requirements of the license, and that CC had not sufficiently warned licensors that publicity rights were not included under the license.","In September of 2007, the plaintiffs brought suit in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas against the mobile company under a number of causes of action, including invasion of privacy, copyright infringement, and breach of contract.

Curry v Audax,Netherlands,Netherlands,Unknown,Dutch,2006-03-09,,CC BY-NC-SA,2. 0,Generic,Photograph,Attribution,334492/KG 06-176 SR,https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/File:Curry-Audax-English.pdf,Case File needs to be more visible and aptly named,Dutch court upheld CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 unported license when Flickr photos were used in a tabloid,Plaintiff alleged a photograph licensed under CC BY-NC-SA was used by a commercial advertiser without proper attribution.,"BACKGROUND
Adam Curry, a former MTV VJ and one of the pioneers of podcasting, published photos onto his Flickr account under a BY-NC-SA license (BY-NC-SA 2.0 unported).
A Dutch tabloid reprinted four of the photos in a story about the Curry family's public persona verses real private life
Curry sued the tabloid for violating the portrait rights of his family and for copyright violation over the improper user of his Flickr photos.
Curry argued that the tabloid violated the BY-NC-SA license by using the photos in a commercial magazine and by not including a reference to the CC license.
The tabloid argued that it thought the photos could be taken and used because they were marked as ""public"" on Flickr. It also argued that in terms of compensation, the photos had no value because they were available for anyone to view online.
SUMMARY
The Dutch court held that, in the future, the tabloid could not use any of the photos from Flickr in the future unless under the terms of the photos' CC license or with permission from Curry.
Several years later, a different tabloid published some of Curry's CC-licensed photos in an article about him, but the parties settled outside of court.
RESULT
Curry's case was the first lawsuit that ever focused specifically on Creative Commons  licenses. The victory on the copyright claims demonstrates and set the precedent that Creative Commons licenses are enforceable in court under copyright law.","Adam Curry, a former MTV VJ and one of the pioneers of podcasting, published photos onto his Flickr account under a BY-NC-SA 2.0 license.

Gerlachs v DVU,Germany,Germany,District Court of Berlin,German,2010-10-08,,CC BY-SA,3. 0,Generic,Photograph,Attribution,16 O 458/10,https://creativecommons.org/2011/09/15/creative-commons-attribution-sharealike-license-enforced-in-germany/,"English translation needs to be fixed, the link is broken, files need to be clearer, and more descriptive",German court upheld CC BY-SA 3.0 unported and granted an injunction against improper use of a photo,Plaintiff alleged a photograph under CC BY SA license was used on a website violating the terms of the CC license.,"BACKROUND

In summer of 2010, the applicant took a picture of the German politician Thilo Sarrazin at a public event and published it online under the Creative Commons license BY SA 3.0 Unported. Later the DVU, a German political party used the picture on their website without the plaintiff's name, the license notice or any other requirement of the license. The applicant sent a notice and takedown letter to which the party didn't react. Subsequently the applicant sought preliminary injunction before the Disctrict Court of Berlin against the unauthorized publication of the picture.
SUMMARY

The District Court of Berlin granted the injunction because the applicant had successfully established prima-facie evidence of authorship, of the licensing and of the breach of the license, thus triggering the right to injunction following from s. 97 ss. 1 in combination with s. 19a Urheberrechtsgesetz (German copyright code).

RESULT

It needs to be noted that there are two levels of evidence under German procedural law: a) probably true, b) proven. For a preliminary injunction one only needs to establish the lesser one a).

Nevertheless, the basic message of this ruling is that the fallback to regular copyright interdiction actually works, because a breach of the license terms leaves the user with no licensed right to use the work. IS THIS NECESSARY INFORMATION? 

This is the first German ruling where from the court's point of view it seems to go without saying that the licensing via notice etc. is valid and thus a CC license has an effect. Even more importantly the ruling suggests that honouring the license terms would have made the use legal, although that was not at the core of the case","In the summer of 2010, the plaintiff took a picture of the German politician Thilo Sarrazin at a public event and published it online under a Creative Commons ShareAlike license. Later the DVU, a German political party, used the picture on their website without the plaintiff's name, the license notice, or a link to the original work.","[CC note: This summary was not verified through an official English translation.]
The photographer sent a takedown notice to the political party, which was ignored. Subsequently, the photographer sought an injunction preventing the DVU from continuing to use the photograph.",The court ruled that the DVU’s use was not in compliance with the CC license and granted the injunction.,"The court assumed that the CC license was valid and enforceable, ruling that a breach of the license terms leaves a reuser with no right to use the copyrighted work.",,Publish

BACKGROUND
Wikitravel is a community-based wiki run by a for-profit entity, Internet Brands. In 2012, some members of the Wikitravel community joined forces with those engaged in Wikivoyage (a project started by former Wikitravel editors) to approach the Wikimedia Foundation about hosting a new travel wiki. After undergoing its standard process for community debate and input, Wikimedia ultimately decided to move forward with the project.

In the meantime, Internet Brands brought suit against two Wikitravel editors who were also members of the Wikimedia community, alleging trademark infringement, unfair competition, and civil conspiracy to take away Wikitravel's web traffic.

SUMARRY 

After Internet Brands agreed to dismiss their unfair competition claim, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California dismissed the remainder of the claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

The associated lawsuit: (Wikimedia Foundation v. Internet Brands)

In response to Internet Brands' lawsuit against members of its community, Wikimedia filed its own complaint against Internet Brands in California state court, alleging that the purpose of the lawsuit filed by Internet Brands was solely to intimidate Wikitravel editors from leaving Wikitravel. Among other things, Wikimedia asked for declaratory judgment that Internet Brands does not have ownership in the Wikitravel content or the right to restrict the use of the Wikitravel content in any way other than as required by the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons BY-SA license, under which all of the Wikitravel content is licensed.
RESULT

Thus, it is not an official Israeli court opinion.

[Please note: This summary is based on a google translation of the original Hebrew text. As such, it may contain errors.]
BACKGROUND
Newspaper used some of Photographers photos in an issue of the newspaper without proper attribution. Photographer contact Newspaper about the omission. Newspaper offered Photographer 400 Sheqels, the price they would have paid a photographer to take a similar photo. Newspaper also corrected their copyright policy going forwards. Photographer did not accept the 400 Sheqel offer and brought suit for copyright infringement.
SUMMARY 
The court first asked the parties to come to an agreement, which they were not able to do.

The court, being a Rabbinical court, analyzed the case under both the Torah and the Israel Copyright Act. The court held that there is a religious obligation (probably ""moral"" if better translated) to comply with the attribution terms of the CC licenses. The court found the Newspaper's offer of 400 Sheqel to be below the value of the benefit the Newspaper had received from using the photo and noted that the Israel copyright act provides for damages up to 100,000 Sheqel.
RESULT
The court found for the photographer and awarded a sum of 3,500 Sheqel.","A newspaper used several CC-licensed photos in an issue of the newspaper without proper attribution.

In the fall of 2005, a Spanish collecting society, the Sociedad General de Autores y Editores (SGAE), sued a disco bar owner, alleging that he had failed to pay SGAE the license fee required for public performances of music managed by the collecting society during the period between November 2002 and August 2005.

RESULT

The Lower Court rejected SGAE's claims because the bar owner had successfully shown that the music he had been playing in his bar was not managed by the collecting society, but was rather licensed by musicians under CC licenses.

TAKE AWAY

Before this decision, the Spanish courts had ruled in favor of SGAE in similar lawsuits under the assumption that the collecting society managed most if not all of the music.

This case set a new precedent in Spain and showed that courts recognize that not all music performed in public will be managed by a collecting society.

European collecting societies are different from those in the US because they take an assignment of rights from the artists.","A Spanish collecting society, the Sociedad General de Autores y Editores (SGAE), sued a disco bar owner, alleging that he had failed to pay SGAE the license fee required for public performances of music managed by the collecting society during the period between November 2002 and August 2005.

It is alleged they were playing non-CC licensed music.,"BACKGROUND

A Spanish collecting society, the Sociedad General de Autores y Editores (SGAE) successfully sued a coffee bar owner, alleging that he had failed to pay SGAE the license fee required for public performances of music managed by the collecting society during the period between June 2003 and November 2004. On appeal, the defendant presented the Creative Commons license and argued that the coffee bar only played openly licensed music. SGAE offered evidence, however, that the business also played music that was part of the SGAE catalogue, such as songs by Gloria Estefan. The defendant did not prove that the relevant rightsholders applied CC licenses to those works.

RESULT

The Provincial Court rejected the appeal because the coffee bar made a public performance of copyrighted works from the SGAE catalogue. Since the copyright holders of the relevant works had not applied the CC license, the defendant’s reference to the CC license had no effect. The opinion stated in dicta that the CC license was “nothing but a mere informatory leaflet about the contents of the license and is lacking any signature; therefore it cannot be asserted any value.” Although some commentators have expressed concern that this language jeopardizes the validity of CC licenses in Spain, the validity of CC license was not at issue as the rightsholders never applied the CC license in the first place.

TAKE AWAY

CC licenses are not effective when applied by anyone other than the copyright holder. Until a copyright holder applies the license to their work, the license has no effect.

While the dicta in this case on a casual read has suggested to some that CC licenses are not enforceable without the licensor’s signature, a closer look at the facts and the opinion appears to indicate that this was not at issue or in dispute. A party wishing to rely on a CC license to play music cannot apply a CC license to a work without permission from the owner.

As a side note, the same court ruled against SGAE in a later, unrelated case, and held that a different venue owner did not have to pay royalties for the public performance of openly licensed works (See Judgment No. 477/2008 of the Provincial Court of Pontevedra, 31 July 2008).","A Spanish collecting society, the Sociedad General de Autores y Editores (SGAE), sued a coffee bar owner, alleging that he had failed to pay SGAE the license fee required for public performances of music managed by the collecting society during the period between June 2003 and November 2004.","[CC note: This is derived from a submission to Creative Commons, but not verified through an official English translation.]

A German website posted a hyperlink to image on another website. That image was available under a CC license, but the website where the image was posted had not complied with the CC license terms and was therefore in violation of the copyright. The photographer who had taken the image filed a lawsuit requesting that the German website take down the link.

RESULT

The court granted an injunction requiring that the link be removed from the German website.

TAKEAWAY

This case was an interpretation of an earlier European Court of Justice ruling that held that a website that would be held liable for copyright infringement when it posted links to infringing material intending to make a profit. The court in this case broadly interpreted what it means for a link to be posted ""for profit,"" stating that the determination is made based on whether the website is intended to make money and not based on whether publishing the particular hyperlink in question was.

As it relates to CC licenses, the significance of the case is that the court took as a given that using a CC license in violation of its terms constitutes copyright infringement.","A German website posted a hyperlink to image on another website.

Plaintiffs uploaded photographs to Flickr and and offered them under a Creative Commons BY-NC-ND license.

Defendant made a collage from the plaintiffs’ and other photographs and sold them without attribution.

RESULTS

The court found the defendant guilty of copyright infringement.

The defendant claimed ignorance of the copyright and license, but the court found that this did not matter.

TAKE AWAY

The court did not consider the CC licenses at all in their opinion, but the outcome of the case was the same as if the decision had been made following the terms of the license.","The plaintiffs, Avi Reuveni and Amir Rivlin, uploaded photographs they had taken during a journey to Jerusalem to Flickr.com. The photographs were published under a Creative Commons BY-NC-ND license. The defendant, Mapa Publishing, copied and used the photographs in a book, but, according to the plaintiff, without proper attribution. One of the photographs was also published on the defendant's website.","[CC note: There is no English translation available at this time. The information provided here is drawn from information provided <a href=""https://www.law.co.il/en/news/2011/01/18/israeli-court-enforces-a-creative-commons-license/"">here</a>.] The main question was the sum of damages to be awarded and how it should be calculated. The court sided with the plaintiffs and ruled that the defendant violated the attribution requirements of the CC license. The court also ruled that a separate act of infringement is committed for each photo. The court stated that there is no justification for regarding all 15 photographs as one work of art, seeing as each photograph describes a different object, was taken at a different time, and by a different person (either of the two plaintiffs). The judge considered the fact that the plaintiffs are not professional photographers who earn their living from photography, and that the defendant removed the infringing books from circulation. However, the court did weigh against the defendants the fact that they are book publishers that are expected to comply with copyright laws more stringently than others.","The court ruled that the infringement of 15 copyrighted photographs should be considered 15 separate acts of infringement, not one single act.","This case was the first time an Israeli court enforced a CC license. The CC license element at issue was the NonCommercial restriction. The court held the infringement of 15 copyrighted photographs should be considered 15 separate acts of infringement, not one single act.",,Publish
